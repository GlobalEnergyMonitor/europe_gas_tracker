    "## TO DO:\n",
    "* For Latin America, put in pipeline capacities in original units for oil pipelines; use converted units for gas pipelines if all have it\n",
    "* for lng_term, for Latin America map: after separating train/phase from terminal name, create columns for 'unit' & 'unit_en'\n",
    "* Instead of manually inserting fixes (using function fix_one_offs), put the missing info into the working files. Then read those, and insert values.\n",
    "  * That way, the values are stored where they need to be for the long term.\n",
    "  * Use pygsheets to read the working files (for all trackers except coal plants, because those are not in the GEM shared drive).\n",
    "  * The problem with this is that some of the missing data is for projects that have been put in the \"removed\" tabs; so they're in a past official release, but no longer in the main data set in the working file. Those would still need hard-coded one-off fixes in this code base.\n",
    "* Assign approximate coordinates using province data when available\n",
    "* Put GOGET production data into map file\n",
    "* Work more with xlsxwriter to format Excel files, using header_format & setting column widths\n",
    "* Assign approximate coordinates based on country for LNG terminals\n",
    "* Region: Add test that it's filled in for every row\n",
    "* Capacity: Add test that at least some rows have data\n",
    "* When reading pipelines using pygsheets, force capacity to be float; this should resolve issue with download file\n",
    "* get rid of 'nan' strings in map file; for Africa gas map, had them for some rows in capacity, lat, lon, route\n",
    "* in GOGET, exclude these statuses: 'UGS', 'decommissioned', 'abandoned'\n",
    "* for Latin America:\n",
    "    * Coal plants download sheet: Instead of column \"Nombre local\", in the Spanish sheet, put this as \"Planta\"\n",
    "    * Coal mines, etc.: similar change?\n",
    "* keep oil & gas pipelines separate, except for map file (where all types of projects are together)\n",
    "* for Excel file writing, left align column headings & set column width = 12\n",
    "* for GOGET, for download file, merge in Spanish wiki pages; then for Spanish download file, use Spanish wiki pages\n",
    "* in Spanish download files, change order of columns to prioritize Spanish entries"
